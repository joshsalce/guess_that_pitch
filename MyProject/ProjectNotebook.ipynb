    "This project is a guessing game based on an event that occurs during a baseball game. Put simply, during a game a pitcher and catcher will use hand signs to signal what pitch to throw. This changes from a single sign to a sequence of signs when a runner is on-base and can see what signs the catcher is using. The runner can then look at the signs and guess what code is being used to generate the sequence that is used. A good example of this, and a large inspiration of this project, comes from this [video](https://youtu.be/UBthUIEtA4Y) which breaks this very situation down."

    "This project simulates the time during a game in which the catcher uses a sequence of signs. You are playing a runner on 2nd base. Your objective, using only the sequence of signs and the pitch that is thrown, is to try and decipher exactly what code is used to generate that sequence. You must decipher five randomly chosen codes out of thirteen different possible codes. These thirteen codes group into three different categories:"

The sum of these two numbers will be the *nth* element in the sequence, and whatever number is at that *nth* point will be the pitch that is thrown. \n",

    "Final Note: This is not supposed to be a particularly easy game to win, since it's not supposed to be easy when it actually happens during a baseball game. I have noticed while playing myself that the sequence and pitch shown with each scenario can be one of at most three possible codes. So with every code that you think can be the right answer, there may be at most two other codes that can be correct as well."

    "My Python background goes back to just about a year ago, when I decided to teach myself Python through Udemy after learning some web development. I covered the same topics and built a few things through it, but I never really got it off the ground and truly applied it until I came to this class where it all clicked. I think I went above and beyond in this project by delving slightly into some Advanced Python. Not only did I utilize the random module through the choice and randint methods, but I also used list comprehensions for the first time. Even though it was covered breifly in the final lecture, I ended up stumbling across them spontaneously, and using them served me very well in completing this project."
