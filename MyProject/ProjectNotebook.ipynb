        "This project is a guessing game based on a specific situation that occurs during a baseball game. Put simply, a pitcher and catcher will use hand signs to signal what pitch to throw (before 2022). This changes from a single sign to a sequence of signs when a runner is on-base. When on-base, a runner can see what signs the catcher is using and potentially figure out what pitch will be thrown, which would then be relayed to the batter. A good example of this, and a large inspiration of this project, comes from this [video](https://youtu.be/UBthUIEtA4Y) which examines this very situation."

I have noticed while playing myself that the sequence and pitch shown with each scenario can be one of at most three possible codes. So with every code that you think can be the right answer, there may be at most two other codes that can be correct as well."

        "My Python background goes back to just about a year ago, when I decided to teach myself Python through Udemy after learning some web development. I covered the same topics and built a few things through it, but I never really got it off the ground and truly applied it until I came to this class where it all clicked. I think I went above and beyond in this project by delving slightly into some Advanced Python. Not only did I utilize the random module through the choice and randint methods, but I also used list comprehensions for the first time. Even though it was covered breifly in the final lecture, I ended up stumbling across them spontaneously, and using them served me very well in completing this project."
